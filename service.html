<p id = "intro">
We have focused on building strong leadership teams for clients and helping individuals find the most suitable positions in an organization through providing quality services. Our executive search team is comprised of experienced business professionals who offer clients truly insightful opinions on their needs and our planned approach. In order to identify the most suitable candidates, our consultants offer sound judgement gained through extensive experience and training during their earlier careers in various business settings around the world.
</p>

<p id = "intro2">
Balancing the art of talent reading is our state-of-the-art scientific evaluation tool, GAPPS4, which is seamlessly integrated with our vast practical experience. GAPPS4 is a powerful assessment tool that provides a comprehensive profile report showing the candidate's competency strengths and priority development areas, and links these to a unique, interactive online learning system. The GAPPS4 full assessment includes a 60-minute personal feedback/coaching session, which could be followed by a more systematic coaching program upon the request of our client.
</p>


<p id = "intro3">
In addition to the above, a traditional competency-based framework is always developed together with our clients to clearly identify skills and behaviors for each and every particular search assignment.  This will also be used as a guiding document in our assessment of candidates as well as in our communication with them.
